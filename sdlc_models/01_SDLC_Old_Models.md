# ðŸ§© SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

- SDLC is a full cycle of developing software.

---

## Waterfall Model (Sequential / Linear)

### Phases
- Requirement (SRS / BRS / FRS)
- Design (low-level document / high-level document) â€“ pictorial form
- Development (based on requirement and design documents)
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

### Advantages
- Quality of the product will be good
- No requirement changes are allowed â†’ fewer bugs
- Initial investment is less â†’ testers hired later
- Suitable for small projects with no requirement changes

### Disadvantages
- No requirement changes are allowed
- If there is a defect in requirement, it continues in later phases
- Total investment is more â†’ rework on defects takes more time â†’ higher cost
- Testing starts only after coding (late bug detection)

---

## Spiral Model (Iterative / Version Control Model)
- Overcomes some drawbacks of the waterfall model
- New features can be added in each cycle
- Every cycle produces a new version released to the customer

### Advantages
- Testing is done in every cycle
- Customer can use each software module released
- Customers can change their requirements after every cycle

### Disadvantages
- Requirement changes not allowed mid-cycle
- No testing in each phase
